    "**ROC** stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. This is a statistical method developed during World War II to analyze the performance of a Radar Operator. Radar Operators were supposed to look at the Radar screen and analyze if a point represented an enemy plane or just random noise. Much later in the 80's when drugs were being developed on a massive scale, the same (ROC) was used to measure the performance of a drug to cure diseases. To understand ROC curve better, let's actually create on in excel."

If you feel this is overwhelming, you can skip to the section where we Interpret the ROC Curve and do the ROC Curve in Python."
