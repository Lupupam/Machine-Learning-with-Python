    "Statistics is probably _**THE MOST IMPORTANT**_ tool in the hands of Data Scientists and Machine Learning experts. In fact Machine Learning is referred to as _**Statistical Learning**_ by statisticians. Statistics started almost 3 centuries ago as a formal science and is a pretty broad subject. We are only interested in learning specific aspects of it as they relate to data science and machine learning. However, we have to understand that Machine Learning is an evolutionary field - statistics happens to be just one of the tools. Some tend to say that ML is just glorified statistics , it is not true. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you look at some of the algorithms used in Machine Learning like K-Nearest Neighbour ( KNN ) the significance statistics ( atleast in it's classic sense ) is very minimal. "

    "You don't need a Ph.D in statistics to be a Data Scientist or ML expert. In fact, when it comes to deep learning, the significance of statistics drops even further. However, statistics still remains the most useful tool in most areas of ML. So, the way we learn statistics would be limited to just the fundamentals of statistical methods as they apply to Machine Learning. Also, we will learn the relevant statistical methods in an incremental fashion. And instead of learning the basic statistical methods as they are, we will keep our approach data oriented. This will provide the context under which we are learning specific techniques. "

    "A population represents the entire data set. For example, if you have the entire data of all the grades in a particular class - that dataset is called the population. The word population can be confusing. It is natural for non-statisticians to refer to population as people or living beings. However, We are not talking about the people of the class, but we are just talking about the data points only. You could be referring to a dataset of median house prices in a county or the age of stars in a particular galaxy. As long as you refer to the entire dataset, it is called as **_Population_**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a small part out of it ( eithe randomly or sequentially or via other criteria ), it is called as a sample. For example, say Uber provides the rating data for all the drivers in New York City. Say there are 40,000 drivers. The entire dataset is referred to as the population. If you want to consider a particular part of the dataset , say a bunch of 10,000 drivers from it, it is called as a **_Sample_**. "

Now, if you draw this pattern out with the actual number of customers (average) on each day of the week you would get a pattern like this. "
