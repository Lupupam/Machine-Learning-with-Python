    "Statistics is probably _**THE MOST IMPORTANT**_ tool in the hands of Data Scientists and Machine Learning experts. Statistics started almost 3 centuries ago as a formal science and is a pretty broad subject. We are only interested in learning specific aspects of it as they relate to data science and machine learning. However, we have to understand that Machine Learning is an evolutionary field - statistics happens to be just one of the tools. Some tend to say that ML is just glorified statistics , it is not true. \n",

    "For example, if you look at some of the algorithms used in Machine Learning like K-Nearest Neighbour ( KNN ) the significance statistics ( atleast in it's classic sense ) is very minimal. "

    "You don't need a Ph.D in statistics to be a Data Scientist or ML expert. In fact, when it comes to deep learning, the significance of statistics drops even further. However, statistics still remains the most useful tool in most areas of ML. So, the way we learn statistics would be limited to just the fundamentals of statistical methods as they apply to Machine Learning. Also, we will learn the relevant statistical methods in an incremental fashion. "
